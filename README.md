# ti89-library
A library of ti89 (titanium) functions I have built and would like preserved for years to come and others to use. 

It is my belief that the ti line of calculators is severely under utilized tool for fields of science and mathematics. 
Being in the CS profession, I view it as an excellent source for containing or making use of machine learning algorithms.
The problem is there are a number of limitations as well as the need to actually program the functions in the first place.

This library contains a number of functions which are built with the aim of being as minimalistic as possible, making use
of redundant code as much as possible, and utilizing functions as much as possible. I recognize that in time these programs will
become obsolete, but it is my hope that I can document at least some of the functions I made with the technology available that with
a few tweaks in the future, can be modified for future iterations. At the very least, it serves as a backup repo in case the calculator
becomes damaged, lost, or simply unable to repair.
